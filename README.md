In this project I scrapped data from Sulekha.com about Nurseries in Delhi NCR region and made a dataset from the scraped data, then cleaned the datset using python code and also manually using excel and added few more attributes manually with excel such as Website link and Social media link of the nurseries by personally finding them by searching with the nursery name on google. Then, I made an graphical analysis of the data using python and generated a report using Microsoft Word after merging all the graphical plots along with the description of information provided by them into a word file and exported it into a pdf file.

You can find the final report into the report folder.

I have also generated the pandas profiling report which is located in the base folder in the file named output.html
